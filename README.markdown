# Kentucky Regulatory Accountability Act

This repository contains the supporting materials for the potential amendment to Kentucky's Administrative Procedures Act in KRS 13A.  The proposal follows closely a bipartisan bill that was introduced in Congress and is known as the "Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017." The Democratic sponsors were Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.) and Joe Manchin (W.Va.) and the Republican sponsors were Rob Portman (Ohio) and Orrin Hatch (Utah).

The original question was how to expand and conduct meaningful cost-benefit analysis in the legislative branch.  And while that question was under examination, it was clear that regulatory promulgation was probably even more extensive.  Thus, it was a natural and appropriate seque to look at Kentucky's Administrative Procedures Act.

Significant and creative amendments were being proposed at the federal level.  The federal act incorporates a number of recommendations from the American Bar Association (ABA) and the Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS). In 2016, The ABA Section of Administrative Law and Regulatory Practice made nine
recommendations.  The federal Regulatory Accountability Act adopts, in part, seven of the nine recommendations.

Given the broad consensus of those who participate in administrative procedures and the bipartisan support at the federal level, it is time for Kentucky to look at amendments to its own administrative procedures act.
